OperatingSystemSimulation is an application that simulates how an Operating System works by executing ten different processes.
It was created in the application Vizard using python. Each process has a process control block which contains Process State, Program 
Counter, CPU Register, Memory Management Information, CPU-Scheduling Information, and Time Slice. Time slice is randomly generated in 
every execution of the program to determine how long each process will take to execute. The ten processes being simulated are summation, 
multiplicaiton, division, power, for loop, user input, average number, largest number, even number, and square root. All ten processes 
successfully ran.
